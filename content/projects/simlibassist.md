## Background
SIM's operations with partnered universities have required students to maintain two sets of credentials for two different libraries in support of our academic pursuit.

While it does sound more of a benefit to the general public, we often face frustration looking for the right resources for our paper writing across two digital libraries.

This extension aims to assist the students with their academic endeavours.
