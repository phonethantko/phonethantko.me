### Hello!

I am an aspiring software engineer, a recent graduate with a computing degree, and (still) an enthusiastic learner in machine learning and web development. I am also an avid learner of languages - I speak Burmese, English and Chinese at the moment. (Korean and Japanese on track)

I enjoy learning new technology and use my expertise to solve problems. Beyond academics, I am also interested in photography - portraits in particular. I spent majority of my free time playing computer games, hitting gym and reading.

### My Life Story

#### Early Days *(Before the grand days)*

I was born in Myanmar and has spent the first 15 years of my life in Yangon, a sunny industrial city situated in the northern part of Myanmar. (Did you know? Yangon used to be the capital!)

That said, I attended primary and secondary school in Yangon before I venture out to Singapore at the age of 15-16(-ish). I have been staying and studying in Singapore ever since.

#### Present

Having graduated recently from Singapore Institute of Management with a degree from University of London, I am currently on the lookout for a rewarding yet challenging 'Software Engineer' position as a new episode of my life.

### Education

I have gone through different education systems in Myanmar and Singapore. Education in Myanmar has helped me built a strong Mathematical foundation for my further studies. (Fun fact - Myanmar education has really taught me to memorize things all the time!) Higher education in Singapore has helped me garnered more hands-on and in-depth knowledge in computer science.
